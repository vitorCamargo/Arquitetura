# Decoder MIPS
👨🏽‍💻💻 Assignment for 'Computer Architecture and Organization' subject about Decoding/Coding binary programs to MIPS (MIPS Assembly) and vice versa.

## More Informations
This project are all made using the programming language C, however, the speaking language was Portuguese.

### Usage
To execute the program, it's necessary to compile the code and execute the compiled file. For that you need to use the following commmand (for that you need to install the GNU Compiler, if you have Windows, you can use an IDE like: DevC++):

```sh
$ gcc PROJECT_NAME.c –o PROJECT_NAME
$ ./PROJECT_NAME
```

The instructions to use each program is already when you try to execute for the first time.

### COD-MIPS
This project has the responsability to translate a MIPS code to binary.

### DECOD-MIPS
This part of the project has the responsability to translate a binary file to a MIPS code.
